      <h2>What is Vote Right?</h2>
      <div class="item">
        <p>Frankly, it's ludicrous to have these interlocking bodies and not...interlock. My Uncle Rory was the stodgiest taxidermist you've ever met by day. But I haven't spent any money! I was all... dead and frugal. The only way some people can find a
          purpose in life is by becoming obsessed with demons. Should I start this program over? It's a real burn, being right so often. Can't call to mom, can't say a word. Nobody could do that much decoupage without calling on the powers of darkness.
          I'll never leave. Not even if you kill me. If I could make you purtier, I would.</p>
