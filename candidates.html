        <p>Everybody started singing and dancing. I saw their production of 'Giselle' in 1890. I wept like a baby, and I was evil! So, are we gonna sing army songs or something? I am obsolete. This must be what old people feel like, and Blockbuster. In their resting state, our actives are as innocent and vulnerable as children. I'm a rogue demon hunter now. Hey I could whip up a love slave any day I wanted. Oh my god, I find lentils completely incomprehensible. Well we could grind our enemies into talcum powder with a sledgehammer but, gosh, we did that last night.</p>

        <p>From beneath you, it devours. Y'all see the man hanging out of the spaceship with the really big gun? No, Angel, it's not you. If I was blind, I would see you. Yes, I'd forgotten you're moonlighting as a criminal mastermind now.</p>
      <p>The human body can be drained of blood in 8.6 seconds given adequate vacuuming systems. Actually, I was fired from a fry-cook opportunity. I'm a comfortador also. Oh my god, I find lentils completely incomprehensible. The human mind is like Van Halen; if you just pull out one piece and keep replacing it, it just degenerates.</p>

        <p>I saw their production of 'Giselle' in 1890. I wept like a baby, and I was evil! And zombies don't eat brains anyway, unless instructed to by their zombie master. It's about power and it's about women and you just hate those two words in the same sentence, don't you? She is the slayer. I recognize the council has made a decision, but given that it's a stupid-ass decision, I've elected to ignore it.</p>
